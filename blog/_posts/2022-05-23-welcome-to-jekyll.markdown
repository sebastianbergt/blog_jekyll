Started this blog with Jekyll. Idea is to write all kinds of snippets down here. 
Whenever doing actual project work, this might also be dropped here.

Learning of the day: creating the application with `jekyll new blog` leaves you with a newly created folder.
Which one needs to `cd` into to start `jekyll serve`.

Otherwise jekyll serves empty index pages...
